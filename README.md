# USGS Data Visualization Project

## Background
In this project, I'm tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet. The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world daily but need a meaningful way of displaying it. 

## Tools Used
- `HTML`
- `Leaflet`
- `geojson API`
- `d3.js`

## Requirements Delivered

### Map
- TileLayer loads without error 
- Connects to `geojson API` using `D3` without error 
- Markers with a size corresponding to earthquake magnitude 
- A legend showing the depth and their corresponding color 

### Data Points 
- Data points scale with magnitude level 
- Data points' colors change with the depth level
- Each point has a tooltip with the Magnitude, location, and depth
- All data points load in the correct locations
